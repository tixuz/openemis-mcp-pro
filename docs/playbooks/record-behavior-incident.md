## Resources

| Resource | Role in this workflow |
|---|---|
| `student-behaviour-categories` | Reference list of incident types (e.g. Bullying, Tardiness, Vandalism) — provides the category id to attach to the incident record. |
| `student-behaviour-classifications` | Reference list of severity levels (Minor, Major, Critical) — provides the classification id that indicates how serious the incident was. |
| `student-behaviours` | The write target — the incident record linked to the student, institution, and academic period, including the description and any follow-up action. |

## Steps

| # | Title | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | List behaviour categories | `openemis_get` | Get the id for the category that matches the incident (e.g. Bullying, Tardiness). |
| 2 | List severity classifications | `openemis_get` | Get the id for the severity level (Minor, Major, Critical). |
| 3 | Write the incident record | `openemis_create` | Create the behaviour record linked to the student, institution, and academic period. |

### Step notes

**Step 1 — List behaviour categories:** Fetch all rows from `student-behaviour-categories`. Review the names and note the `category_id` that best matches the incident type being recorded. This id is required in step 3.

**Step 2 — List severity classifications:** Fetch all rows from `student-behaviour-classifications`. Note the `classification_id` for the appropriate severity level (Minor, Major, or Critical). This id is required in step 3.

**Step 3 — Write the incident record:** POST to `student-behaviours` with the following required fields: `student_id`, `institution_id`, `academic_period_id`, `date_of_behaviour` (YYYY-MM-DD), `description` (narrative of what happened), `student_behaviour_category_id` (from step 1), and `student_behaviour_classification_id` (from step 2). Optional fields: `action_taken` (what the teacher or admin did in response) and `follow_up_date` (if a follow-up is scheduled).
